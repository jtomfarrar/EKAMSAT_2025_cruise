1. Precipitation:

Precipitation is available from several moorings
across the Tropical Pacific and Atlantic since 1998,
and more recently from the Indian ocean. 

If you selected high resolution data, you may find that 
you have several files, each with a different averaging
interval, for example, hourly and 10 minute. The interval 
is indicated by the filename suffixes "hr" or "10m". 

Also included in daily files are time series of standard 
deviation, and percent time raining. Precipitation has 
units of millimeters per hour and is measured at a height 
of 3.5 meters above mean sea level. (Instrument height 
is shown as a negative depth in data files).

To reduce instrumental noise, internally recorded 
1-minute rain accumulation values are smoothed with a 
16-minute Hanning filter upon recovery. These smoothed 
data are then differenced at 10-minute intervals and 
converted to rain rates in mm hr-1. The resultant rain 
rate values are centered at times coincident with other 
10-minute data (0000, 0010, 0020...). 

Occasionally this procedure results in small negative 
rain rates which, while counter-intuitive, should be 
considered part of the noise in the data, and are 
balanced by the presence of small positive rain rate 
noise. Thus, setting all of the small negative rain 
rates to zero would result in a slight positive bias 
in, for example, a daily average computed from 10 minute 
rain rates, or a monthly accumulation.

2. Time Stamp:

Time associated with data that is processed and stored
on board by the moored buoy data acquisition system is
described for each sensor in the sampling protocol web page
at http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/gtmba/sampling.

Time associated with data that have been averaged in
post-processing represents the middle of the averaging
interval. For example, daily means computed from post
processed hourly or 10-min data are averaged over 24
hours starting at 0000 UTC and assigned an observation
time of 1200 UTC.

3. 5-day, Monthly and Quarterly Averages:

If you delivered 5-day, monthly, or quarterly averaged data
these definitions are relevant to your files:

5-Day: Average of data collected during consecutive five day 
intervals. A minimum of 2 daily values are required to compute 
a 5-day average.

Monthly: Average of all the data collected during each month.
A minimum of 15 daily values are required to compute a monthly 
average.

Quarterly: Average of 3 monthly values. A minimum of 2 monthly 
values are required to compute a quarterly average. 12 quarterly 
averages are computed for each year, one for each center month, 
which includes the previous month, the center month, and the 
next month in the average.

4. Sampling, Sensors, and Moorings:

For detailed information about sampling, sensors, and moorings,
see these web pages:

5. Quality Codes:

In ascii format files organized by site, you will find data 
quality and source codes to the right of the data. In NetCDF 
format files organized by site, you will find quality and 
source variables with the same shape as the data.
These codes are defined below.

Using the quality codes you can tune your analysis to 
trade-off between quality and temporal/spatial coverage.
Quality code definitions are listed below

  0 = Datum Missing.

  1 = Highest Quality. Pre/post-deployment calibrations agree to within
  sensor specifications. In most cases, only pre-deployment calibrations 
  have been applied.

  2 = Default Quality. Default value for sensors presently deployed and 
  for sensors which were either not recovered, not calibratable when 
  recovered, or for which pre-deployment calibrations have been determined 
  to be invalid. In most cases, only pre-deployment calibrations have been 
  applied.

  3 = Adjusted Data. Pre/post calibrations differ, or original data do
  not agree with other data sources (e.g., other in situ data or 
  climatology), or original data are noisy. Data have been adjusted in 
  an attempt to reduce the error.

  4 = Lower Quality. Pre/post calibrations differ, or data do not agree
  with other data sources (e.g., other in situ data or climatology), or 
  data are noisy. Data could not be confidently adjusted to correct 
  for error.

  5 = Sensor or Tube Failed.

6. Source Codes:

  0 - No Sensor, No Data 
  1 - Real Time (Telemetered Mode)
  2 - Derived from Real Time
  3 - Temporally Interpolated from Real Time
  4 - Source Code Inactive at Present
  5 - Recovered from Instrument RAM (Delayed Mode)
  6 - Derived from RAM
  7 - Temporally Interpolated from RAM
  8 - Spatially Interpolated (e.g. vertically) from RAM
